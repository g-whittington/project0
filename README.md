# project0
CS50w week0, week1, and week2 initial project.
This is the first project in the CS50w course. The basic idea is to create three pages. 

The first page looks and functions like the google home page.Specifically having a search bar that redirects to a Google search, an actual search button, 
and a I'm Feeling Lucky button. Which in this context just takes you directly to a website for what you are serching, rather than a normal search result.

The second page is similar to the first page, but it searches with Google Images, rather than traditional search

The third pages is in the style of Google's Advanced Search site. Things like Find pages with… “all these words:”, Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”,
Find pages with… “any of these words:”, and Find pages with… “none of these words:”.
